TIFU by getting into the wrong train car in Japan

Obligatory this happened over a decade ago.

At the time - 2008 if I remember correctly - I was a foreigner living and working in Japan. I got that opportunity over a year or two prior, so learned Japanese in a short amount of time (<1 year), and before I knew it I found myself in Japan. My Japanese language skills weren't great, but they were good enough to communicate and read/write basic things.

This incident happened only few months into my stay. At the time I was living in Kawasaki, which is a city not too far from Tokyo, and my office was in Tokyo. This meant I had to take two trains to work, the second of which was on the 'Chuo Line', which was one of the busiest train lines in the city. The trains are often packed ([those videos you've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7kor5nHtZQ) where station workers push people in? yeah, that happens there), and they come and go really frequently. As in, a train every couple of minutes frequently during the rush hours.

So, on that fateful day, when I got to the platform, I spotted a queue that was quite a bit shorter than the rest. My lucky day! I thought. This should have been my first warning - that it's too good to be true - but what do I know, I'm an idiot on a foreign country. And I was distracted by my all-new shiny touch screen phone that was a miracle to behold. But I digress - I joined the said queue which moved quickly, and I was in a train car that was pretty empty (everything's relative, folks - by empty I mean all the seats were full but not many people were standing), and I was still glued to my phone screen.

The train started moving, and I was still on my phone, but then, you know that feeling you get when something's off? The feeling you get when someone's staring at you? Yeah, so I got the feeling that people were kind of staring at me, and I looked up and noticed two things. One, people were indeed staring at me. Two, all the said people were women.

Now, at this point in the story, I should mention that I'm a Sri Lankan man.

What's the big deal whatissevenbysix, you might ask? Do you have something against women? No, neither I nor any other Sri Lankans have anything against women (hey, we elected world's first female Prime Minister 60 years ago you know), but the thing is, statistics dictate that there should be at least few men in the train car, which there weren't. So I looked around a little bit, and suddenly spotted the [very pink and very obvious signs](https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2015/06/woman-only-train.jpg) that said "Women Only". All the color drained out of my face, and let me tell you, that's quite a feat for a very brown dude.

At that point there wasn't much I could do so I buried myself in my phone again, and the women continued to stare at me like they had been doing for the past few minutes, and overall, it was some of the most awkward few minutes of my life. 10/10 would not recommend.  As soon as the train came to a stop at the next station I got the hell out of the train car at the next station, which probably prompted a few unsuspecting women in the queue at the next station to wonder if they had indeed seen The Flash.

And that's how I learned that [there were women only train cars in Japan](https://jobsinjapan.com/living-in-japan-guide/the-history-of-the-woman-only-train-carriages-in-japan/).
